File ownership is an important component of Linux that provides a secure method for storing files. 

Every file in Linux has the following attributes −
Owner permissions − The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.
Group permissions − The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
Other (world) permissions − The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.

File Access Modes
The permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a system. 
The basic building blocks of permissions are the read, write, and execute permissions.

Read
Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the contents of the file.

Write
Grants the capability to modify, or remove the content of the file.

Execute
User with execute permissions can run a file as a program.


You can modify permissions with the chmod command.
It uses a number to specify each set of permissions for the file.

Each permission is assigned a value, as the following table shows -

Number	  Permission Representation		      Ref
0		      No permission				              ---
1		      Execute permission			          --x
2		      Write permission				          -w-
3		      Execute and write permission		  -wx
4		      Read permission				            r--
5		      Read and execute permission		    r-x
6		      Read and write permission		      rw-
7		      All permissions				            rwx

For eg. 777 means owner, group and others all have read, wirte and execute permission.
