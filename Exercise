Exercise 1: Word-frequency in US Declaration of Independence

Using only the utilities we've seen so far, write a single pipeline that will ultimately output (both to stdout and to a file called usdechistogram.txt) the top 10 words, by frequency (and ignoring case) in the US Declaration of Independence, along with the number of times each occurs.

This group exercise will require a lot of reading of man pages and iterative trial and error, and it brings together most (or all) of the skills we've learned so far. Go for it!

Command: 
wget -qO - https://web.math.princeton.edu/~perezgiz/usdec.txt | tr -s '[:punct:][:space:]]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c -i | sort -n | tail | tee usdechistogram.txt

Explanation -
wget -qO url --> get data from url and display on stdout
tr -s '[:punct:][:space:]]' '\n' --> replace punctuation and whitespace with a newline character
sort --> sort all the words alphabetically so its easy to sqaush and find unique count
uniq -c -i --> returns the count of word after sqaushing and ignores case
sort -n --> sorts by number
tail --> returns the last 10 lines
tee filename --> redirects output to both display and file
