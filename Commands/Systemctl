Systemctl is a command-line utility in Linux systems that is used to manage and control the system service manager.

With systemctl, you can start, stop, restart, enable, disable, and check the status of services. Here are some commonly used systemctl commands:

systemctl status <service_name> --> provides the current status and some information about a specified service

sudo systemctl start <service_name> --> starts a specified service

sudo systemctl stop <service_name> --> stops a specified service

sudo systemctl restart <service_name> --> restarts a specified service

sudo systemctl enable <service_name> --> enables a specified service to start automatically at boot

sudo systemctl disable <service_name> --> disables a specified service from starting automatically at boot

systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --> lists all available services on the system
