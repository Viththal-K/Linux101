1) Find the length of array ->
i=0
while read lines
do 
    i=$((i+1))
done

echo $i

2) Read the content of each line into an array and then display the entire array ->

i=0
while read lines
do 
    array[i]=$lines
    i=$((i+1))
done

echo ${array[@]}  # prints entire array 

3) Slice the array and display only the elements lying between positions 3 and 7, both inclusive ->

i=0
while read lines
do 
    array[i]=$lines
    i=$((i+1))
done

echo ${array[@]:3:5}  # selecting 3th,4th,5th,6th,7th element from the array, so 5 elements from 3.

4) Read the contents of each line into an array and then filter out (remove) all the names containing the letter 'a' or 'A' ->

i=0
while read country
do
    if [[ $country != *"a"* && $country != *"A"*  ]];
        then
        array[$i]=$country
        i=$((i+1))
    fi
done

echo ${array[@]}

5) The first capital letter (if present) in each element of the array should be replaced with a dot ('.'). Then, display the entire array ->

array=$(sed 's/[A-Z]/./')
echo $array

6) Find the number that occurs only once in an input stream ->

read n
arr=$(cat)
echo $arr | sed 's/ /\n/g' |sort -n |uniq -u
# sed 's/ /\n/g' is used to replace all occurrences of a space character with a newline character "\n" in a given input stream
