1. AWK Operations: 
a) Scans a file line by line 
b) Splits each input line into fields 
c) Compares input line/fields to pattern 
d) Performs action(s) on matched lines 

2. Useful For: 
a) Transform data files 
b) Produce formatted reports 

3. Programming Constructs: 
a) Format output lines 
b) Arithmetic and string operations 
c) Conditionals and loops 


NR: NR command keeps a current count of the number of input records. Remember that records are usually lines.
 
NF: NF command keeps a count of the number of fields within the current input record. 


Commands:

awk '{print}' <filename> -> prints every line of the file

awk '/<pattern>/ {print}' <filename> -> prints lines that matches the pattern

awk '{print $2,$3}' <filename> -> prints specific columns from the file

awk '{print NR,$0}' <filename> -> prints all lines displaying its number

awk 'NR==3, NR==6 {print NR,$0}' <filename> -> prints lines between 3 and 6

awk 'END  {prnit NR}' <filename> -> prints the count of lines in a file

awk 'length($0) > 10' <filename> -> prints lines with more than 10 characters
