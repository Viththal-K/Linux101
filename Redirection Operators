Linux has 3 core file streams:

stdin --> defaults to keyboard (abbrev 0)
stdout --> defaults to screen (abbrev 1)
stderr --> defaults to screen (abbrev 2)

>                              # redirect stdout to a file ((overwrites existing contents)
1>                             # same as above
>>                             # redirect stdout to a file (appends to any exisiting contents)
2>                             # redirect stderr to a file (clobbers)
2>&1                           # redirect stderr to wherever stdout is
<                              # redirect input from file to command
                               # (order of redirections matters!)
                               
 Example: rcho Hello 2 > error101 --> rcho isn't a command and throws error which is stored in error101 and not displayed on the screen.                              
                               
# PIPES
The pipe operator | is placed between two commands that sit on a single line

Example: cat file1 file2 | sort | head
